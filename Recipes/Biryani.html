            <p> <b>Biryani</b> is a mixed rice dish that was thought to have originated from Iran or South India. It is made with rice, some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by substituting vegetables for the meat.</p>
   
            <p> Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia, as well as among the diaspora from the region. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, Thailand, and Malaysia. </p>
